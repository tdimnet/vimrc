# Vimrc

## Hi there!
Welcome to my vimrc GitHub repo.

If you know what to exit vim, this content might be interesting for you. Since
8 eights, I use and love Vim. I know trying to use Vim can be tedious. Also,
getting to know the right extension can be a tauding task.

Here is a list of great extension I use on my daily basis. You should see that
I have two seperate config: one for my main computer and the other one for my
Raspberry Pi.

Hope you like it here!
